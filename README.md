    Introduction: First of all, thanks to Jake Wharton (https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP) for the ThreeTenABP
    and thanks to Basil Bourque (https://github.com/basil-bourque) for the clean code.

    Note:
    1. Instant is new way to store date which is from latest Java.
    2. We are using the threetenabp to make it work because it supports lower Android version.
    3. Instant is store as UTC format. for example: "2019-05-13T14:13:02.291Z"

    4. If you want to display back by using method ConvertTarikhMasa2LocalTime().
    5. You can change how to display by change the 'ofPattern' at variable DateTimeFormatter formatter.
